MemeMe
======

MemeMe is the second project for [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003). It's the capstone app for the [UIKit Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/uikit-fundamentals--ud788) course.

Users can choose a photo from the iPhone's camera roll, snap a photo with the iPhone's camera, and then add text at the top of the bottom of the screen to create a meme. The user can then share the meme through text, email, or social media through UIKit's UIActivityViewController. Each shared meme is temporarily saved to a model, and the user can choose to see the set of recently shared memes using either a UITableView or a UICollectionView.
